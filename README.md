# Example_shooter
Example shooter is a JS Phaser framework shoot-em-up prototype game. It is my first attempt at creating a game with Phaser framework and JS as a whole. The spirtesheets i have used are NOT mine. All of them belong to or are reskins of Luis Zuno's assets. Whom's tutorial i also used to create the game, although i have deviated quite a bit and added some things of my own. 

!!! IF YOU WANT TO RUN THE GAME YOU WILL NEED A LIVE SERVER. THE EASIEST WAY TO DO THAT IS TO DOWNLOAD THE EXTENSION FROM VSCODE "Live Server" !!!
